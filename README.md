# Machine-Learning
### cs18s038_PA1 Course Project ###
Implemented following models-
* Binary Bayes Classifiers from data with Max. Likelihood.
* Multiclass Bayes Classifiers from data with Max. Likelihood.
* Bias-Variance analysis in regression.
* Analyse overfitting and underfitting in Regression.

### cs18s038_PA2 Course Project ###
Implemented following models-
* Implemented Logistic Regression with RBF kernel and did the hyperparamter tunning(kernel parameter, regulariser, learning rate).
* Implemented SVM for different kernel type(RBF, linear, poly).
* Implemented Decision tree with purning(at what height stop spliting).
* Implemented Random Forest Classifier and tuned with(hyper parameter- Fraction of data to learn tree=0.5, Fraction of number of features taken per data=0.5).

### cs18s038_PA3 Course Project ###
Implemented following models-
* Run k-Nearest neighbours on the binary classification dataset for classifiying whether a given movie is a comedy or not.
* Implemented PCA and regression.
* Implemented Baseline methods for collaborative filtering.
* Implemented EM algorithm for Gaussian Mixture models.
